       " '- The Mythos of Elden Ring was written by George R. R. Martin. Mythos refers to the overall narrative theme or plot structure. It can also be interpreted as a belief system.\\n- The Story of Elden Ring was written by Hidetaka Miyazaki and his team at FromSoftware\\n- The Lore and Story of Elden Ring are told in a similar manner to other FromSofware \"Souls\" games, so players should expect to find plenty left to interpretation as well as seemingly contradictory statements about various game characters, elements, and concepts.',\n",
       " 'Elden Ring Lore Overview',\n",
       " 'The storyteller folds her slender hands - both pairs - and speaks. “It happened an age ago. But when I recall, I see it true.” So begins the tale of the Shattering, a devastating war between the children of Marika, Demigods of the Lands Between. One grim night in the depths of winter, a flock of unknown assassins stole across the Lands Between.\\nIn a coetaneous attack, this foul covenant snuffed out the lives of many of the God-Queen’s kin throughout the empire, too numerous and too scattered for her godly protection to save. The assassins’ targets were multifold, but none was as devastating a loss to the Eternal Queen as that of Godwyn the Golden. After his death, the Elden Ring was somehow shattered, and the order of the world broke with it.\\nOut of this chaos came war. Open, bitter war, pitting blood against blood and kin against kin. The conflict broke a vast and prosperous empire into brittle fragments. No single side could find enough purchase to maintain a decisive victory, even when fueled by the power of a Great Rune.\\nThe battle of General Radahn against Malenia the Severed illustrated that neither strength nor skill alone would be enough to take control of the entirety of the lands Marika had united. And so, the Lands Between are no longer gripped by open war, but caught in an uneasy stalemate that seems impossible to resolve. “Unless of course,” the storyteller says, a coy smile on both her lips, “thou shouldst take the crown?”\\nTake a deeper dive into the carefully crafted mythology of George R.R. Martin – author of The New York Times best-selling fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire – and the world created by FromSoftware based on his work in this new trailer available here.\\nTransported to ages long ago, you will relive the Shattering, a war that brought darkness to the Lands Between, initiated by demigods’ hunger for power. You’ll fight alongside General Radahn and Malenia the Severed, but even these two undefeatable warriors couldn’t reunite a world so badly broken. There is only one hope left: the hope that a new Elden Lord will rise and lift the veil of shadows that has fallen over Marika’s domain.\\nThe wait is almost over. Soon you’ll venture into the Lands Between and strive to become its Elden Lord. Stand ready, Tarnished, and prepare to claim what fate has promised you.',\n",
       " 'Elden Ring Location Lore\\nThe Lands Between is the world of Elden Ring, and those who live in The Lands Between were blessed by Grace through the Elden Ring and the Erdtree. Those who were blessed by the Elden Ring are characterized by having a golden aura that can be seen in their eyes. However, at some point, some of those who were blessed lost their grace; they were exiled and labeled the Tarnished.  As time passed, for unknown reasons, the Elden Ring was shattered and its shards were scattered across the Lands Between. The largest of these pieces were called Great Runes and were claimed by the six Demigod children of Queen Marika the Eternal, causing them to inherit different powers and have been physically changed and twisted due to being corrupted by the power of these runes.\\nThe Lands Between is divided into 7 distinct areas,',\n",
       " '- Limgrave\\n- Caelid \\n- Liurnia of the Lakes \\n- Altus Plateau \\n- Mt. Gelmir\\n- Mountaintops of the Giants\\n- The River Kingdoms (underground) \\n- Each overseen by a Demigod, and features a central \"overworld\" that connects all of these areas. According to an interview with Miyazaki, players will have total freedom as to the order they want to tackle for each area, and it is up to the player on how they want to approach it. The hub area similar to Firelink Shrine or Majula in previous games will not be accessible at the beginning of the game, which means you will need to progress the game until you reach the hub area.',\n",
       " '------------------------------------------------\\nElden Ring Character Lore',\n",
       " 'The Tarnished\\nAccording to Hidetaka Miyazaki: \"The Lands Between is supposed to invoke this feeling of something that\\'s very mysterious and very ethereal – and we hope that when players play the game, they\\'re going to experience that.\"\\nIn the opening of the official reveal trailer that was presented in E3 2021, we see a softly spoken, hooded woman saying \"The Tarnished, will soon return.\" The question is, who and what is The Tarnished? Simply put, you are the Tarnished. As the player, you are one of the Tarnished that have been exiled upon losing their blessing of Grace granted by the Elden Ring and the Erdtree, a tree that hosts source and life of The Lands Between. Very much like previous Souls games, where you are the Chosen Undead or the Ashen One. After the shattering of the Elden Ring, you are then called back by this lost Grace to The Lands Between, along with other Tarnished to recover the shards of the Elden Ring, to make them whole once again, and to become the Elden Lord of The Lands Between.\\nAccording to Hidetaka Miyazaki in an interview: \" I feel like one of the main themes of the game is how the player, the Tarnished, approaches or treats this new-found grace and this return to the land that they were once banished from, how they interpret this and the meaning. It\\'s not just the player-character, of course, it\\'s lots of characters in the game, who are all beckoned back and will have their own adventures and motives. We want the player to discover for themselves what that means and how they want to begin their adventure.\"',\n",
       " 'Melina\\nOne of the first people the Tarnished encounters on their journey, Melina maintains an air of mystery throughout the game. She does not have a physical form and acts as the Tarnished\\'s Finger Maiden in exchange for taking her to the Erdtree, then later on, to the Mountaintops of the Giants. She approaches the Tarnished to aid her in her search for her purpose given to her by her mother, who she believes can be found at the base of the Erdtree, leading many to speculate that her mother is Marika. When summoned, she wields the Blade of Calling, a dagger that was previously owned by the kindling maiden, fitting considering her role as kindling when the Erdtree is burnt down. Speaking with Melina at various Sites of Grace reveals her ability to recall echoes of Queen Marika\\'s past actions and words, which she offers in lieu of a \"maiden\\'s guidance\".\\nMelina holds contempt for the Frenzied Flame and believes that whoever lords over the chaos and damage it brings is no Lord at all. If the Tarnished takes the Frenzied Flame before the event at the Forge of the Giants, she will leave them and will threaten to deliver them Destined Death once they become Lord of the Frenzied Flame.',\n",
       " \"White Mask Varre\\nThe White Masks encountered in Mohgwyn Palace were initially abducted by Mogh, Lord of Blood and turned into Bloody Fingers through an unknown ritual involving Mogh's accursed Omen blood. Of the four White Masks the Tarnished encounters in game, only Varre was able to withstand and tame the accursed blood. Despite being abducted by the Lord of Blood, he remains loyal to the Mohgwyn Dynasty and tries to indoctrinate the Tarnished into the dynasty. Even as he is dying at the at the end of his questline, forsaken by his Lord, he calls out to Mohg and blesses the Mohgwyn Dynasty.\",\n",
       " \"Bloody Finger Hunter Yura\\nA samurai from the Land of Reeds whose purpose is to hunt down Bloody Fingers. His biggest target is Eleonora, Violet Bloody Finger, a Tarnished whom he holds in high regard. It is uncertain what exactly caused Eleonora's corruption into a Bloody Finger - Yura himself warns the Tarnished against the dangers of Dragon Communion, stating that those who partake in it one day lose their humanity. On the other hand, other Bloody Fingers the Tarnished encounter, some of which are Yura's targets, are those that have been approached and swayed by Mohg, the Lord of Blood himself.\",\n",
       " \"Sorcerer Rogier\\nA Tarnished that, despite his easy-going nature, is said to be a wise and powerful sorcerer by his old travelling companion, D. Rogier was once a scholar seeking the truth behind the Night of the Black Knives. His scholarly pursuits eventually brought him under Stormveil Castle, where he found and disturbed a corpse, causing him to be afflicted with Death. As opposed to D who sees Those Who Live in Death as a threat against the Golden Order, Rogier is empathetic towards them, believing them to have committed no offence. By finishing Rogier's quest, the Tarnished is able to help him reveal many insights about the night of the assassination before he finally succumbs to his affliction.\",\n",
       " \"Fia\\nA Tarnished Deathbed Companion driven from her home when awoken by the guidance of grace. Fia describes a Deathbed Companion as a person who receives warmth and life from numerous champions, and then lays with the remains of an exalted noble to revive them, an act she says is revered in her homeland. She is empathetic towards Those Who Live in Death and put it upon herself to be their guardian.\\nBefore meeting her at Deeproot Depths, the Tarnished will encounter her champions - one of which is Rogier, and another who is Lionel the Lionhearted, a knight Fia met on her journey to the Lands Between who declared being her father. After bringing together Ranni's half of the Cursemark of Death from the Divine Tower of Liurnia and Godwyn's half from D, she implies that being Godwyn's Deathbed Companion will have him be reborn as a rune representing Those Who Live in Death - the Mending Rune of the Death-Prince.\",\n",
       " \"D, Hunter of the Dead\\nA devout follower of the Golden Order, D hunts Those Who Live in Death, most notably Tibia Mariners for their Deathroot. He has a twin brother whose dialogue suggests his name is Darian. Despite having separate bodies and separate minds, the twins share the same soul and one cannot be conscious when the other is. Where other Orders would have seen them as cursed beings, the two twins found comfort in the Golden Order, the one Order that doesn't. D states that Those Who Live in Death go against the principles of the Golden Order, and so they must be exterminated.\",\n",
       " \"D, Beholder of Death\\nD's Twin Brother, whose name is inferred to be Devin from D's voicelines. He can be found slumbering in the Siofra Aqueduct while D is alive, and in the same place grieving when D is dead. Despite not being able to talk and interact with one another, the two brothers seem to be close as he swears revenge against his brother's killer, whether it be Fia or the Tarnished, when given his brother's armor set.\",\n",
       " \"Gurranq, Beast Clergyman\\nA large beastman who hungers for Deathroot. Before meeting the Tarnished, D was in charge of hunting for and providing Gurranq with these Deathroot. It is heavily implied that the Beast Clergyman the Tarnished encounters in Crumbling Farum Azula is Gurranq himself as he recognises them if they have given him all 9 Deathroot. It is therefore also implied that Gurranq is Maliketh, the Black Blade.\\nMaliketh is Marika's Shadow bestowed upon her by the Greater Will as an Empyrean, like how Blaidd is to Ranni. According to the Stone of Gurranq, Maliketh was a ferocious warrior whose name meant 'Death of the Demigods'. He was ordered by Marika to lock away the Rune of Death, also referred to as Destined Death. However, a fragment of the rune was stolen and used in the Night of the Black Knives, leading to the death of the first demigod, Godwyn the Golden. To ensure the rune was never stolen again, Maliketh bound his sword, imbued with the Rune of Death, within his own body and changed his name. His Remembrance implies that he was betrayed by Marika, though in what exact matter is unknown.\",\n",
       " \"Roderika\\nA Tarnished driven away from her home across the sea. The cloak she wears implies that she used to be a member of royalty. At some point upon arriving at the Lands Between, she happened upon White Mask Varre, who gave her the same advice as he gives the Tarnished at the beginning of their journey - to seek Godrick and his Great Rune at Stormveil Castle. Upon arriving at Stormhill, the men escorting her were taken and sacrificed for grafting, leaving her in guilt about the fact that she's too afraid to join them.\\nShe moves to the Roundtable Hold to find purpose after receiving the hopeful echoes of her men through the Chrysalids' Memento. Here, Smithing Master Hewg recognises her potential for spirit tuning through her eyes, and with a bit of encouragement from the Tarnished, trains her to be a skillful spirit tuner. The two become close, and even as the Roundtable Hold is burning down, she stays behind with him to repay his kindness.\",\n",
       " 'Smithing Master Hewg\\nA misbegotten chained and imprisoned at the Roundtable Hold. Here, he is tasked by Queen Marika to smith a weapon strong enough to kill a god, a task that he makes his life goal. Hewg strongly believes the Tarnished will be the one to become Elden Lord, and will say so before he completely loses his memory.',\n",
       " 'Nepheli Loux\\nAdoptive daughter of Sir Gideon Ofnir. According to Gideon, he took her in when she lost the guidance of grace and became a Tarnished. Nepheli is a skilled warrior who believes in standing up and enacting justice for the weak and oppressed. She once believed that her adoptive father held the same beliefs, but after learning that he was the mastermind behind the attack on the Village of the Albinaurics, she loses faith in him. It is speculated that Nepheli has ties with the first Elden Lord, Godfrey, and therefore the Golden Lineage, as she bears the same last name as Hoarah Loux and as Kenneth Haight deems her worthy of taking up the mantle of leader of Limgrave.',\n",
       " \"Kenneth Haight\\nA member of the Erdtree royalty, self-proclaimed rightful leader of Limgrave and owner of Fort Haight. Kenneth looks down on Godrick and deems him unworthy of ruling Limgrave for his cowardly actions during the Shattering, as well as not possessing the proper lineage required to rule. After taking back Fort Haight from Godrick's forces and seeing the state it's been left in, Kenneth laments that he doesn't have the authority to rule Limgrave and goes on to look for an eligible candidate, until he finally comes across Nepheli Loux.\",\n",
       " \"Gatekeeper Gostoc\\nThe Gatekeeper of Stormveil Castle. Despite this, he informs the Tarnished of a safer side passage to allow them to enter the castle undetected. He can be caught sneaking and following the Tarnished around in the castle, and each time they are defeated, Gostoc steals a portion of the Golden Runes they drop. It seems he does this with each Tarnished that comes to Stormveil Castle to challenge the shardbearer.\\nGostoc holds contempt for the master of the castle, Godrick, having been mistreated and looked down upon by him. Much of Gostoc's dialogue reveals that he longs for freedom from his master and duties. However, when Nepheli takes the throne, he is happy to return to his duties.\",\n",
       " \"Boc the seamster\\nA demi-human outcast often picked on for his looks. He looks up to his late mother, who was a skilled seamstress and one of few the few people who cared for him. Boc was kicked out of his former home in the Costal Cave and had his possessions stolen by the other demi-humans. After the Tarnished helps him take back his prized Sewing Needle and Tailoring Tools, he offers to tailor their armor as compensation.\\nThroughout his interactions with the Tarnished, Boc expresses unhappiness towards his looks. The Tarnished can either grant Boc a Larval Tear to help change his appearance or let him know he's accepted, both of which, though different in outcome, Boc is grateful for.\",\n",

Throughout his questline, Corhyn shows high and unwavering faith in the Golden Order. He is greatly interested in discovering the secrets of the Order, and so leaves the Roundtable in search for Goldmask, a great scholar of Golden Order fundamentalism.\\nAfter introducing him to Goldmask, Corhyn acts as Goldmask's scribe, translating and recording his various finger movements into written records. Corhyn holds Goldmask in high regard, but after learning of his reservations towards the Golden Order, Corhyn begins to question his master's intentions.\",\n",
       " \"Goldmask\\nThe ever brilliant Goldmask is a famed scholar of Golden Order fundamentalism and one of many Tarnished called back to the Lands Between after the Shattering. He doesn't speak and instead communicates through rhythmic hand and finger movements.\\nGoldmask once lamented that hunters of Those Who Live in Death had been reduced to fanatics of the Golden Order and hunted simply for the sake of having an evil to fight against. Throughout his questline, the Tarnished aids him in better understanding the Golden Order, most notably in the nature of Radagon, to correct the imperfections that lie within the Order. With the Mending Rune of Perfect Order, Goldmask concluded that the imperfections found were due to the very gods being just as fickle as ordinary men. \",\n",

It is uncertain what or where his real form is as he returns to his shack as he was before most times after being attacked.\\nAfter Malenia's Scarlet Aeonia bloomed in Caelid during the Shattering, Gowry dedicated his services to her, believing her to be the one to bring about a new order - the Order of Rot. In the swamp of Aeonia, he found Millicent, and presumably her sisters, as babies and proceeded to raise them, hoping that when Malenia one day ascended to be the Goddess of Rot, they too would be reborn as scarlet valkyries. Of all the sisters, Gowry saw the most potential in Millicent to follow in Malenia's footsteps.\\nAt the end of Millicent's quest, Gowry asks the Tarnished to aid Millicent's sisters in attacking her. He believes that the betrayal she feels from the person she trusted the most will act as a catalyst for her to 'bloom'.\",\n",
       " \"Millicent\\nA daughter of Malenia, Millicent shares many striking similarities with her mother - bright red hair, a missing arm from her severe scarlet rot affliction, and skilled swordsmanship that resembles her mother's style. Due to the scarlet rot, though she feels a sense of familiarity within Gowry's Shack, Millicent does not remember her childhood with Gowry.\\nUpon being cured using the Unalloyed Golden Needle, Millicent sets out on a journey to seek Malenia. She hopes that she may be able to aid Malenia in resisting the call of the scarlet rot. Before she's able to reach the Empyrean, she is ambushed by her sisters at Elphael and possibly the Tarnished if they so choose. If the Tarnished defends her instead, Millicent reveals that she is aware of what Gowry hoped to she would bloom into.

She cares much for her father and implores the Tarnished to deliver a letter persuading him to leave the castle.\\nTheir reunion unfortunately never happens as she gets murdered.

It seems that the Tarnished is not the only person bringing her Shabriri Grapes.

She took after her mother and discovered her own full moon - Ranni's Dark Moon - and learnt cold sorceries from the mysterious Snow Witch she encountered deep in the woods. It seems that since childhood, she's held Blaidd and Iji dearly. At some point, Ranni defeated the Glinstone Dragon, Adula, who then swore their allegiance to her.\\nAlthough she wasn't born a demigod, Radagon's unity with Marika made her eligible to be an Empyrean. Despite this, Ranni did not want to be controlled by the Two Fingers and rejected her fate. In an act of rebellion, Ranni masterminded the Night of the Black Knives, stealing the Rune of Death and imbuing its power in the knives of the Black Knife Assassins. On the night of the assassination, Ranni's body died and her soul was transferred into a doll reminiscent of her old master, Renna, the Snow Witch.\",\n",

According to Jerren, the blades smithed by Iji were blunt, but were able to resist decay when faced against scarlet rot.\\nIji also acts as Ranni's war counselor, providing her and those under her with guidance on the lost city of Nokron. He cares very much for both Blaidd and Ranni and has watched over them since they were children.

The nomads used to prosper as a group known as the Great Caravan. They were however accused of heresy and were cast deep underground to be buried alive. There, they summoned the flame of frenzy. Kale describes the nomadic clan as spiteful, and so it is presumed that their summoning ritual was done out of spite. The note on the Lord of Frenzied Flame implies that the nomads came to worship the frenzied flame.\\nThis is further substantiated by pieces of Kale's cut quest that community members have been able to find. In this piece of cut content, the Tarnished would have aided Kale in discovering what happened to the Great Caravan. This would have led them to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds, more specifically to the Frenzied Flame Proscription. He would comment on the bodies of the nomad clan found on the way to the underground area - 'sick', 'maddened', 'husks of themselves', 'hardly human anymore'. He finds out that his people were falsely accused of worshipping the Three Fingers and summoning the frenzied flame into the Lands Between. This fills him with spite towards the Greater Will and the Golden Order.

Scholars whose studies were deemed worthy received a glintstone crown, with Sellen having a unique one from other scholars the Tarnished encounters at the academy. However, she was exiled from the academy for her obsession and forbidden pursuit of the primeval current.\\nWhile not specified in-game, there are two speculated reasons that pursuing the primeval current is prohibited at the academy. One being the dangers it brought to the sorcerer pursuing it. During her quest, Sellen mentions two other primeval sorcerers, Master Lusat and Master Azur, both of which were masters of glintstone sorcery banished from the academy. Based on the sorceries each of them gives the player, their minds were broken simply by taking a glimpse into the primeval current.\\nIt is also speculated that it is forbidden due to requiring human sacrifices. According to Jerren, Sellen has killed many of her fellow sorcerers in her studies. The Graven-School Talisman notes that fashioning the bodies of sorcerers into 'seeds of stars' is one method of pursing the primeval current.\\nBecause of her scholarly pursuits, Sellen was imprisoned in Witchbane Ruins by the academy and the Carian Royal Family.

She had two consorts during her reign, the first being Godfrey. They had three children together, Godwyn the Golden, and the Omen twins, Morgott and Mohg.\\nTo spread the influence of the Golden Order, Marika and her followers, on behalf of the Greater Will, waged wars against several factions and gods in the lands between, the most notable ones being the Storm Lord, the fire giants and their god, the One-Eyed God, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria and the Carian royal family. While it is unclear which side instigated the war, there were also wars against the Dragons and the Godskin Apostles and their god, the Gloam-Eyed Queen.\\nThough the war against the Giants ended in their favor, Marika realized that she would be unable to extinguish the flame at the Forge of the Giants, the fabled 'flame of ruin' strong enough to burn the Erdtree, and thus cursed the final Fire Giant survivor to protect the forge for all eternity. When the last war was finally over, Marika took the the blessing of grace from Godfrey and his warriors, turning them into Tarnished, and exiled them from the Lands Between. It was then that she took Radagon to be her second consort, and had the twins Miquella and Malenia.\\nAt some point, Marika started to harbor doubts towards the Greater Will and the Golden Order. It is speculated that she had a hand in the Night of the Black Knives due to her rumored connection with the Black Knife Assassins.

Another running theory is that he was cursed to have red hair by the Fire Giants as a result of the Golden Order's war with them. Either way, Radagon was said to have hated the red-tint of his hair.\\nIn the war against Liurnia of the Lakes and it's inhabitants, he was tasked by Marika to lead the Erdtree's armies. The sword monuments the Tarnished can find in Liurnia suggest that there were two Liurnian Wars, and that it was after the second war that Radagon and Rennala fell in love. Radagon sought absolution at the Church of Vows using Celestial Dew, and the two were bonded by marriage, uniting the Capital of Leyndell and Academy of Raya Lucaria. The Glintstone Kris is one of the symbols of the unity of the two factions.\\nAs is tradition, Rennala bestowed a Moon Greatsword onto Radagon, her spouse. They bore 3 children - General Radahn, Praetor Rykard, and Lunar Princess Ranni. However, much to Rennala's dismay, Radagon gifted her an Amber Egg and left her to join Marika's side when Godfrey and his fellow Tarnished were exiled from the Lands Between. They had the twin demigods, Miquella and Malenia, and he reforged his Moon Greatsword into the Golden Order Greatsword.  A speculated explanation for the requirement of both Faith and Intelligence in casting Golden Order Incantations is due to Radagon having learnt sorceries while Rennala's consort and incantations when consort to Queen Marika.\\nIt is revealed by a statue in the Royal Capital that Marika and Radagon are one and the same. It is unlcear whether they were always one, whether Radagon is a fragment of Marika, or as Melina's dialogue suggests, that they became one after becoming consorts.

It also seemed that during his reign, gladitorial combat in colosseums all over the Lands Between were commonplace as rituals held to honor the Erdtree. This practice died out when Radagon became Marika's next consort.\\nAfter Godfrey won his last campaign and there were no worthy opponents left to battle with, Marika took away the Erdtree's blessing from him and countless others, turning them into Tarnished, whom he led out of the Lands Between in a journey referred to as the Long March.

As is tradition, Rennala bestowed upon her consort a Moon Greatsword, which was later reforged into the Golden Order Greatsword. Their union bore three children, Lunar Princess Ranni, General Radahn, and Praetor Rykard. One night, Rennala took Ranni out stargazing as she did in her childhood. This is what led to Ranni meeting her own moon, the Dark Moon.\\nWhen Godfrey was exiled from the Lands Between and Radagon returned to Marika's side, Rennala was devastated and grew weak. Her charm over the Academy fell as well, and its scholars rebelled against the Carian royal family, with the Cuckoo Knights launching an attack against Caria Manor and Rennala ending up being locked up in the Grand Library, where the Tarnished finds her cradling the Amber Egg given to her by Radagon as a parting gift.\",\n",

This encounter caused his accursed omen blood to ignite, and gave him the ability to cast bloodflame incantations. Mohg used his spear, Mohgwyn's Sacred Spear, to further communicate with the Formless Mother.\\nAt some point he managed to escape from the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds, and established the Mohgwyn Palace in a secluded part of the Siofra River. He recruited multiple people to become followers of the upcoming Mohgwyn Dynasty, offering deals to some, like Bloody Finger Okina, and kidnapping others, like the War Surgeons.\\nWhile he is not an Empyrean himself and thus unable to ascend to godhood, he hoped to claim the title of monarch by raising empyrean Miquella to full godhood and becoming his consort.

At some point, Rykard met Tanith in a foreign land and brought her back to the Lands Between to be his consort.\\nRykard had a hand in the Night of the Black Knives, though to what extent is unclear. The Blasphemous Claw was an item rewarded by his sister Ranni allowing him to challenge Maliketh as a last resort. The description for the Taker's Cameo implies that Rykard believed that Marika and her Order ruled by force, and so he swore himself to blasphemy and sought to overthrow them, an ambition that drew many towards him.\\nThe ancient people of Mt. Gelmir worshipped a powerful serpent god that they would offer up sacrifices to. Rykard one day encountered the God-Devouring Serpent and offered himself and his Great Rune up as sacrifices to grant himself immortality, allowing him to grow and devour people and gods alike for all eternity. This fall into greed and glutinous depravity caused most of his followers to turn against him, with Tanith being a notable exception. Those who were once Gelmir Knights sought out the Serpent-Hunter, a great spear designed to hunt the immortal serpent, to put an end to their Lord.
