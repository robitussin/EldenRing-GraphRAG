Giant's Red Braid,"Hefty whip woven from the flame-red hair of a Fire Giant. Every giant is red of hair, and Radagon was said to have despised his own red locks. Perhaps that was a curse of their kind."
Urumi,"This weapon made of extremely thin, flexible blades of metal is wielded like a whip by Nightfold warriors. Though in essence a whip with a cutting edge, it can also be used as a spear to pierce foes."
