The Shattering is a devastating war between the children of Marika. The children of Marika are Demigods of the Lands Between. After Godwyn the Golden's death, the Elden Ring was somehow shattered. The power of a Great Rune fueled the conflict. The battle of General Radahn against Malenia the Severed illustrated that neither strength nor skill alone would be enough to take control of the entirety of the lands Marika had united. The Shattering was initiated by the demigodsâ€™ hunger for power. The Lands Between is the world of Elden Ring. Those who live in The Lands Between were blessed by Grace through the Elden Ring. Those who live in The Lands Between were blessed by Grace through the Erdtree. Those who were blessed by the Elden Ring are characterized by having a golden aura that can be seen in their eyes. At some point, some of those who were blessed lost their grace. Those who lost their grace were exiled and labeled the Tarnished. At some point in time, the Elden Ring was shattered. The shards of the Elden Ring were scattered across the Lands Between. The largest pieces of the Elden Ring were called Great Runes. The Great Runes were claimed by the six Demigod children of Queen Marika the Eternal. The six Demigod children of Queen Marika the Eternal inherited different powers.

When summoned, Melina wields the Blade of Calling. The Blade of Calling is a dagger that was previously owned by the kindling maiden.

Melina offers echoes of Queen Marika's past actions and words in lieu of a 'maiden's guidance'. Melina holds contempt for the Frenzied Flame.
